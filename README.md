# GiniIndexDecisionTree
Code for Creation of a Decision Tree using Gini Index


The current code works only for the following cases of input for now:
-	Data set with maximum 3 class labels for each column
-	Data set having last column labeled as ‘buys’ with 2 labels ‘yes’ and ‘no’
Binary branch names

The code produces the first level splitting of the decision tree along with the branch names for the binary split.
